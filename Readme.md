Heart structure is a unique system that can generate ECG signals independently via heart contraction and expansion. Basically, an ECG signal consists of PQRST waves. All these waves represent different heart functions. Normal healthy heart can be simply recognized by normal ECG signal while heart disorder or arrhythmias signals contain differences in terms of features and morphological attributes in their corresponding ECG waveform.
This can be followed by application of distributed deep learning algorithm for learning the patterns so as to do predictions about the blood glucose measurement for the Diabetes analysis.
